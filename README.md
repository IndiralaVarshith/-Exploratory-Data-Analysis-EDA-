📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on gender_submission.csv
Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the gender_submission.csv dataset.
The objective is to understand the dataset's structure, visualize patterns, identify key statistics, and summarize findings.

This EDA uses Python with essential libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to extract insights from the data.

📂 Dataset Information
File: gender_submission.csv

Columns:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.

Survived: Target variable (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived).

🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
Python 3

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

OS module (for file checking)

📥 Installation
Before running the project, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository or download the code.

Ensure gender_submission.csv is placed in the same directory as your notebook or script.

Run the Python file or Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code.

Example for loading data:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('gender_submission.csv')
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Steps
Load and preview the dataset.

Check dataset shape, data types, and basic statistics.

Identify missing values and unique counts.

Visualize data distributions using:

Histograms

Boxplots

Correlation Heatmap

Pairplot

Summarize key insights from the data.

🔎 Key Observations
The dataset contains no missing values.

PassengerId is purely an identifier; it does not influence the Survived outcome.

The Survived column shows a class imbalance (more passengers did not survive).

Limited feature set — further analysis requires additional variables such as Age, Sex, Pclass, etc.

📌 Conclusion
This EDA gives an initial understanding of the Titanic survival data structure.
Further analysis with a richer dataset (like train.csv) would enable deeper insights into survival factors.
